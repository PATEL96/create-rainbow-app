Easily bootstrap your **RainbowKit**-based project with a single command!
Supports **`Bun`** and **`Yarn`** for dependency management. ðŸš€

---

## Features

- Clone a pre-configured [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) template repository.
- **Choose between Pages Router or App Router** during setup.
- Installs dependencies with **Bun** (preferred) or **Yarn** automatically.
- Automatically configures Web3 providers based on your router choice.
- Provides clear next steps for starting your development server.

## Router Support

The CLI now supports both Next.js routing approaches:

- **Pages Router**: Traditional Next.js routing with `_app.tsx` for providers
- **App Router**: Modern Next.js routing with `layout.tsx` and client components

During setup, you'll be prompted to choose your preferred router type. The template will be automatically configured with the appropriate file structure and provider setup.
